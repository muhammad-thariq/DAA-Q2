## How to Run
Open the project (this repo) in a Java-compatible IDE.

Open graphExec Class, and run it.

When you run the program, it will ask you to input some several options, whether to terminate the process, view the feeds, or tweet something.

If the user inputs the number 1, the system will output "Operation aborted," indicating that the process has been terminated.

If 3 is chosen, you will be prompted to enter a String, which will then be added to the database. It will then be shown as the first feed in the timeline.

If 2 is chosen, it will simply output the timeline, much like option 3 but without entering a new feed.
